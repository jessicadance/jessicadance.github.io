		<div id="intro">
			<p>
				I have decided to present this timeline on the relationship between dance and computer-based technology. I initially planned to cover the broader topic of “dance and technology”, covering a large span of history, from the era of gas-lighting innovations to the advanced technologies of today. However, during my research I became increasingly interested in specifically computer-based technologies. Therefore I have concentrated my timeline on the age of the computer, from 1946 to today. The term “computer-based technology” covers not only innovations such as the CD-ROM, choreographic software, and specific uses of the internet, but also those such as motion-capture technologies and Virtual Reality.<br>
				<br>
 				It seemed fitting to present my timeline as a website, which I have built from scratch. It was a daunting challenge, but in doing so, the process of creating this timeline became an interaction with the very area history I have chosen to present. Where possible, I have provided images, videos, and links so that you may experience some of the creations being described for yourself.<br>
 				<br>
				I hope that you enjoy this rather specific journey through history. By looking at events in this way, we can see how the early pioneers who ventured to bring computer technologies and dance together laid the foundations for the incredible innovations we are seeing today. Perhaps you, like me, will wonder at all the possibilities of where the collaboration between dance and computer technology will lead to next. <br>

				<br>
				<span class="date"><strong>1969</strong></span>

			 Artist Paul Sermon presented the work <em>Telematic Dreaming</em>, at an exhibition of contemporary art in Amsterdam. ‘It involved two beds, one in the gallery with the viewers and one at a remote location.

Cameras and television screens allowed the performer to see his or her body interacting with the viewers, as they touched the bed’ (Popat, 2006, p. 53- 54).<br>

			  Richard Lord created the work <em>Progressive 2,</em> featuring video clips showing different sections of the same dance ‘in a variety of fragmented arrangements, so that the dance does not flow smoothly… a comment on the nature of web-based work at the time when most people were still accessing the web via modems, with their narrow bandwidth requiring the compression of data to the minimum size’ (Popat, 2006, p. 50-51).<br>
			  <br>
			 <span class="date"><strong>1997</strong></span>
			  Richard Lord created two more web-based works: <em>Lifeblood</em>, a dance which drew ‘on the idea of the ‘virtual’ dancer having no physical presence at all’ and existed only as a text description of what the dance would look like (Popat, 2006, p. 49); and <em>Brownian Motion</em>, a ‘web dance’ in which ‘the user can click on little gold men and little blue armchairs to make them move on a black screen. Different key combinations attract the men and armchairs to move towards to cursor, or dispel them around the screen’ (Popat, 2006, p.50). Although it no longer exists, you can try a simulation based on the same technology by clicking <a href= "http://www.richardlord.net/flint-particles/examples/brownian-motion.html" target="_blank">here!</a> <br>
